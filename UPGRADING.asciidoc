Upgrading
=========

## From Graylog 1.x to 2.0.x

### Changed configuration defaults

For better consistency, the defaults of some configuration settings have been
changed after the project has been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration defaults
|===
| Setting name                 | Old default       | New default

| `elasticsearch_cluster_name` | `graylog2`        | `graylog`
| `elasticsearch_node_name`    | `graylog2-server` | `graylog-server`
| `elasticsearch_index_prefix` | `graylog2`        | `graylog`
|===


### Changed prefixes for configuration override

In the past it was possible to override configuration settings in Graylog using
environment variables or Java system properties with a specific prefix.

For better consistency, these prefixes have been changed after the project has
been renamed from _Graylog2_ to _Graylog_.

.Configuration override prefixes
|===
| Override                 | Old prefix       | New prefix | Example

| Environment variables | `GRAYLOG2_`        | `GRAYLOG_` | `GRAYLOG_IS_MASTER`
| System properties | `graylog2.`        | `graylog.` | `graylog.is_master`
|===
