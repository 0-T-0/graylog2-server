            Extractors of <em>@input.getTitle</em>
        </h1>

        Extractors are applied on every message that is received by this input. Use them to extract and transform
        any text data into fields that allow you easy filtering and analysis later on.
        Example: Extract the HTTP response code from a log message, transform it to a numeric field and attach it
        as <em>http_response_code</em> to the message.
